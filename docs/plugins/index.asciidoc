scripts, custom discovery and more.

    in the cluster.  After installation, each node must be restarted before
    the plugin becomes visible.

deprecated[2.3.0] These plugins contain static web content like Javascript, HTML, and CSS files,
that can be served directly from Elasticsearch. Site plugins may only need to
be installed on one node, and do not require a restart to become visible. The
content of site plugins is accessible via a URL like:

    http://yournode:9200/_plugin/[plugin name]

--

Mixed plugins::

    deprecated[2.3.0] Mixed plugins contain both JAR files and web content.
